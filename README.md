## Overview

`invaentory` is a very fast IPv6 and IPv4 LAN scanner, with the intention of allowing the user to quickly take inventory of hosts on their network.

## Installation

Static binaries are available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/invaentory/releases).

On Linux, you can install them like so:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/invaentory "https://github.com/pojntfx/invaentory/releases/latest/download/invaentory.linux-$(uname -m)"
$ sudo install /tmp/invaentory /usr/local/bin
$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/local/bin/invaentory # This allows rootless execution
```

On macOS, you can use the following:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/invaentory "https://github.com/pojntfx/invaentory/releases/latest/download/invaentory.darwin-$(uname -m)"
$ sudo install /tmp/invaentory /usr/local/bin
```

On Windows, the following should work (using PowerShell as administrator):

```shell
PS> Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/pojntfx/invaentory/releases/latest/download/invaentory.windows-x86_64.exe -OutFile \Windows\System32\invaentory.exe
```

You can find binaries for more operating systems and architectures on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/invaentory/releases).

## Usage

To take inventory of all the IPv6 and IPv4 hosts in your LAN, simply run `invaentory`. Note that while Linux allows for rootless execution, macOS requires the use of `sudo` and Windows the use of PowerShell as administrator:

```shell
$ invaentory
172.17.0.1
Pinging   7% [>                           ] (4612/65553, 200 host/s) [23s:5m4s]
```

Once the scan is finished, all found hosts will be listed:

```shell
$ invaentory
172.17.0.1
100.64.154.241
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:40e3:c0ea:d71c:db75
100.64.154.242
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:da47:32ff:fec9:62a0
100.64.154.244
2001:7c7:2121:8d00::3
100.64.154.243
fe80::b2a8:6eff:fe0c:ed1a%enp0s13f0u1u2u2
100.64.154.254
100.64.154.246
100.64.154.250
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:8c77:a50a:e3a9:d284
100.64.154.250
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:d125:4d82:b9f7:5a00
100.64.154.247
```

It is also possible to exclude certain IPs by supplying a regular expression to `--exclude`:

```shell
$ invaentory --exclude '100..*'
172.17.0.1
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:40e3:c0ea:d71c:db75
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:da47:32ff:fec9:62a0
2001:7c7:2121:8d00::3
fe80::b2a8:6eff:fe0c:ed1a%enp0s13f0u1u2u2
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:8c77:a50a:e3a9:d284
2001:7c7:2121:8d00:d125:4d82:b9f7:5a00
```

The progress bar and logging output is written to `STDERR`, so you can further process just the IP addresses as usual, for example to scan all the IPv6 nodes using `nmap`:

```shell
$ for host in $(invaentory -4=false); do nmap -6 ${host}; done
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-15 02:42 CET
